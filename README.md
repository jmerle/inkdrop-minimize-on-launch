This plugin makes it possible to minimize Inkdrop on launch using the `--minimize` flag. Optionally it can also be configured to minimize Inkdrop on every launch in the plugin's settings, and it supports hiding the window completely instead of minimizing it.

## Install

ipm install minimize-on-launch
